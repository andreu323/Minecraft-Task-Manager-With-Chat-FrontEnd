this is my minecraft task manager with chat app frontend. 

** to run project u should have .env file at the project folder and u should put backend adress at that file like that:
VITE_BACKEND_ADDRESS=http://localhost:4000 **


made with sveltekit and tailwind css.

backend link: https://github.com/andreu323/Minecraft-Task-Manager-With-Chat-App-Backend

this app was created at june 2023 and it took me 3 month thats why this code looks trash (and becouse it was my first app).
